# SBC Blacklist
> A simple yet useful blacklist.

### FAQ

> What is this?

A blacklist of Sandbox websites. If you are from the community you probably understand why this exists.

> What is a Sandbox?

To sum it up, roblox ripoffs, people love them, and so do scammers.

> When is a Sandbox elegible for blacklist?

Whenever they show incompetence at handling user data / privacy, or they are just too vulnerable to be used.

This means any website that:
- Runs a bopimo / retrimo / vertineer / kaplash / brick-hill 2017 / epicclub source, is automatically blacklisted.
- That has been hacked atleast twice in less than a year is automatically blacklisted (until the owner demonstrates proper counter-measures)
- That has comitted exit scams (BrickPlanet, Avasquare) is automatically blacklisted. EVEN IF THE OWNER CHANGES
- That has demonstrated poor handling of users (Rocapia, BLDN-Hill) is automatically blacklisted.
- That's owned by Wind / Sesurio (Blood / Cat) is automatically blacklisted.

> Why wind?

About every website that Wind has *"programmed" has been either hacked, shut down, or came out as an exit scam.

*PS: He didnt code them he used sources.

> Why Blood / Cat?

While Wind might not be capable of writing any line of code thats original, Blood does code (big props to that), but has possibly the worst reputation amongst the community.

A small list of things he's done:
- Expose licensed private code
- Expose users private data (IP Addresses, E-Mails)
- Dox deceased people to harass their family members.
- Generally being toxic (BLDN-Hill)
- Exit scam using his website (up to 2000â‚¬)
- Offensive jokes in public chats
- Raiding and harassment of other users

etc... 

Where is the list of sites?
